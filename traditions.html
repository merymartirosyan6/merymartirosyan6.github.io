    <h1>CHRISTMAS PUDDING</h1>
  <p>
Christmas puddings were nothing like the fruity and sweet dessert we have today. Instead the dish was a type of porridge. It tended to be a soupy and savory dish made with beef, mutton, prunes, raisins, spices and wine. In poorer households sometimes a thick version of this dish was eaten to fill stomachs before a meagre serving of meat, including at Christmas. The dish started to become more like the dessert we know now by the end of the 16th century as it became sweeter and was thickend into something like pudding.

    <h1>SANTA CLAUS</h1>
    <p>
      Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas is a figure which comes from the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas. He is a historical figure who brings gifts to the homes of the good children during the late evening and overnight hours of Christmas Eve, December 24th. The legend is based on the tales concerning the historical figure of gift giver Saint Nicholas. While Saint Nicholas was originally portrayed wearing a red coat with white collar and cuffs, white-cuffed red trousers, and black leather belt and boots. This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the influence of caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast. In the United Kingdom and Europe, he is identical to the American Santa Claus, but he is commonly called Father Christmas.

    <h1> CHRISTMAS CRACKERS</h1>
    <p>Christmas crackers were invented in the 19th century by a baker called Tom Smith. While he was on holiday in France he noticed that bonbons were wrapped in colored paper, twisted at each end, he thought this was a good idea. When he returned to England he oprned a factory and started to make them. After a while he included a chemically treated piece of card which exploded when the cracker was pulled. The 'crackers' were a huge success and soon they were being filled with small toys and romantic messages. By 1900 he was selling 13 million crackers worldwide each year.
